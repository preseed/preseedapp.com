Applicability of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to Chattodo’s online workplace productivity tools and platform, including the associated Chattodo mobile applications (the ‘Services’), https://chattodo.preseed.in/ and other Chattodo websites (collectively, the ‘Websites’) and other interactions (e.g. customer service enquiries, user conferences, etc.) that you may have with Chattodo. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, then do not access or use the Services, Websites or any other aspect of Chattodo’s business. For the avoidance of doubt, this is the only privacy policy that applies to Chattodo.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party applications or software that integrate with the Services through the Chattodo platform (‘Third-Party Services’), or any other third-party products, services or businesses who will provide their services under their own terms of service and privacy policy. In addition, a separate agreement governs delivery, access and use of the Services (the ‘Customer Agreement’), including the processing of data such as messages, files or other content submitted through Services accounts (collectively, ‘Customer Data’). The organisation (e.g. your employer or another entity or person) that entered into the Customer Agreement (the ‘Customer’) controls its instance of the Services (its ‘Collections’) and any associated Customer Data. If you have any questions about specific Collections settings and privacy practices, please contact the Customer  whose Collections you use. If you have an account, you can check https://chattodo.preseed.in/ for the contact information of your collections owner(s) and administrator(s). If you have received an invitation to join a Collections but have not yet created an account, you should request assistance from the Customer that sent the invitation.
Indian DPDP Act 2023 Notice of collection of personal information: We collect the information described below under ‘Information we collect and receive’ for the business and commercial purposes described below under ‘Information use’. To learn more about exercising your Indian privacy law, please review the ‘Indian DPDP Act 2023’.
Information we collect and receive
Chattodo will collect and receive information through operating the Services and Websites, and through other interactions with Chattodo. Such information will include Customer Data and other information and data (‘Other Information’) in a variety of ways:
•	Customer Data. Customers or individuals granted access to a Collections by a Customer (‘Authorised Users’) routinely submit Customer Data (such as messages, files or other content submitted through Services accounts) to Chattodo when using the Services.
•	Other Information. Chattodo also collects, generates and/or receives the following categories of Other Information:
1.	Collections and account information: To create or update a Collections account, you or our Customer (e.g. your employer) supply Chattodo with an email address, phone number, password, domain and/or other account set-up details (for more detail on Collections creation). In addition, Customers that purchase a paid version of the Services provide Chattodo (or its payment processors) with billing details such as credit card information, banking information and/or a billing address.
2.	Usage information:
	Services metadata. When an Authorised User interacts with the Services, metadata is generated that provides additional context about the way that an Authorised User uses the Services. For example, Chattodo logs the Collections, channels, people, features, content and links that you view or interact with, the types of files shared and what Third-Party Services are used (if any).
	Log data. As with most websites and technology services delivered over the Internet, our servers automatically collect information when you access or use our Websites or Services and record it in log files. This log data may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the address of the web page that you visited before using the Website or Services, browser type and settings, the date and time that the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins, and your language preferences.
	Device information. Chattodo collects information about devices accessing the Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this Other Information often depends on the type of device used and its settings.
	Location information. We receive information from you, our Customers and other third parties that helps us to approximate your location. We may, for example, use a business address submitted by your employer (who is our Customer) or an IP address received from your browser or device to determine approximate location to assist with localisation or for security purposes.
3.	Cookie information: Chattodo uses a variety of cookies and similar technologies in our Websites and Services to help us collect Other Information. For more details about how we use these technologies, and your opt-out controls and other options, please visit our Cookie policy.
4.	Third-Party Services information: A Customer can choose to permit or restrict Third-Party Services for its Collections and Chattodo can receive personal data from such Third-Party Services. Typically, Third-Party Services are software that integrate with our Services, and a Customer can permit its Authorised Users to enable and disable these integrations for its Collections (for more details on third-party application management, settings and permissions, click here). Chattodo may also develop and offer Chattodo applications that connect the Services with a Third-Party Service. Once enabled, the provider of a Third-Party Service may share certain information with Chattodo. For example, if a cloud storage application that you are using is enabled to permit files to be imported to a Collections, we may receive the user name and email address of Authorised Users, along with additional information that the application makes available to Chattodo to facilitate the integration. Authorised Users should check the privacy settings and notices in these Third-Party Services to understand what data may be disclosed to Chattodo. When a Third-Party Service is enabled, Chattodo is authorised to connect and access Other Information made available to Chattodo in accordance with our agreement with the provider of the Third-Party Service and any permission(s) granted by our Customer (including by its Authorised User(s)). Examples of information which Chattodo may receive in this manner include whether you successfully created a new account or interacted with a third-party application in a way that is attributable to Chattodo usage activity. We do not, however, receive or store passwords for any of these Third-Party Services when connecting them to the Services. For more information on Chattodo’s interaction with Third-Party Services.
5.	Contact information: In accordance with the consent process provided by your device or other third-party API, any contact information that an Authorised User chooses to import (such as importing an address book to find colleagues and Chattodo Connect contacts or calendar from a device or API), forward or upload to the Services (for example, when sending emails to the Services) is collected when using the Services.
6.	Third-party data: Chattodo may receive data about organisations, industries, lists of companies that are customers, website visitors, marketing campaigns and other matters related to our business from parent corporation(s), affiliates and subsidiaries, our partners or others that we use to make our own information better or more useful. This data may be combined with Other Information that we collect and might include aggregate-level data, such as which IP addresses correspond to postcodes or countries. Or it might be more specific: for example, how well an online marketing or email campaign performed.
7.	Audio and video metadata: Chattodo may receive, capture and store metadata derived from your use of features such as Chattodo huddles or clips, and additional related data such as data regarding the date and time of your Chattodo huddle and the Authorised User that you connected with.
8.	Additional information provided to Chattodo: We also receive Other Information when submitted to our Websites or in other ways, such as responses or opinions that you provide if you participate in a focus group, contest, activity or event, feedback that you provide about our products or services, information that you provide if you apply for a job with Chattodo, enrol in a certification programme or other educational programme hosted by Chattodo or a vendor, request support, interact with our social media accounts or otherwise communicate with Chattodo.
